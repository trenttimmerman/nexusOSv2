3. **Speed is a feature.** Sub-second page loads aren't nice-to-have, they're mandatory. Speed = sales.

4. **AI is a tool, not magic.** We use AI to eliminate tedious work, not to replace human creativity.

5. **Lock-in is evil.** Our users should stay because we're great, not because leaving is painful.

6. **Design matters.** Beautiful stores sell more. Period.

7. **Developers are users too.** Great developer experience = great merchant experience.

8. **Data drives decisions.** Opinions are cheap, data is priceless.

9. **Open beats closed.** Open standards, open APIs, open architecture.

10. **We're building for decades, not quarters.** Short-term wins don't compromise long-term vision.
